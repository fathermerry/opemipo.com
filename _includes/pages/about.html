  <p>My name is <a href="/name">Opemipo Aikomo</a>.</p>
  <p>I was born in Lagos, Nigeria and I've lived here most of my life. My parents and two siblings also live in Lagos.</p>
  <p>I make things and tell stories on the internet. My most recent project is a collection of publishing experiments called <a href="https://wuruwuru.com/about" target="_blank">Wuruwuru</a>.</p>
  <p>I'm a self-taught web and software designer. I learnt most of what I know on the internet and on the job. Many of my personal and professional friendships were also made online. Quite literally, the internet saved my life.</p>
  <p>I'm very curious and always excited to learn. My biggest interests are design, typography, history, archiving, mixology, psychology, economics, art and technology in general.</p>
  <p>I try to be as many things as I can.</p>
