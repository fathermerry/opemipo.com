  <p>My name is Opemipo Aikomo. I design software and web experiences.</p>
  <p>I was born in Lagos, Nigeria and I've lived here for most of my life.</p>
  <p>I like to make things and tell stories.</p>
  <p>I'm currently making a collection of publishing experiments called Wuruwuru. It includes a database of album cover art, an animated short film about casual homophobia and a comic about weed.</p>
  <p>I'm making each one with a different group of people and learning a lot about comics, animation, music and film production in Nigeria.</p>

  <p>I direct the Design team at Paystack. I joined Shola Akinlade and Ezra Olubi in 2015 to build the first version of the brand, website and product and I've been stuck here since. In 2020, the company was acquired by Stripe. </p>
  <p>I'm writing a series of essays about my experience before the acquisition.</p>

  <p>Before Paystack, I worked at Delivery Science, Devcenter and Helloworld.</p>

  <p>I'm curious about design, storytelling, craft, history, archives, psychology, economics, art, the web and technology in general. I'm fascinated by life, people and people who do things well.</p>
  <p>I'm trying to be as many things as I can.</p>
