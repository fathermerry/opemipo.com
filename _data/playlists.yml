  about: One night in uni, I woke up and Zombie by The Cranberries was playing in my head. I walked quite a distance in the middle of the night just to get internet to find the song. And I did! This is a curation of similar songs from strangers on Twitter, songs with an interesting history.

  about: This playlist is dedicated to Jubril's 335. When you listen to it, imagine you're in a BMW convertible, top down, driving fast on Bourdillon. If you can re-enact it, even better.
